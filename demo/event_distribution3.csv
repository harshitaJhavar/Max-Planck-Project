After narrowly rescuing Buckbeak at the right moment before Walden can execute him -LRB- so Albus and Rubeus would not be accused of setting Buckbeak free -RRB- , Harry and Hermione hide near the Whomping in the Forbidden to wait for the `` other Harry and Hermione '' and everyone else to return from the Shrieking . During this time , Harry tells Hermione about the man he saw across the lake and how he thinks it was his father who conjured the Patronus . After two hours , following Remus 's transformation , Harry decides they need to head back to Rubeus 's empty cabin so Remus does n't attack them . After spending some time in hiding , Harry leaves the cabin to check out the present situation and sees himself , Hermione , and Black fainting from Dementors . He realises that the silver stag he saw earlier across the lake was not cast by his dad and conjures a powerful Patronus that drives Dementor away . When it returns to him , he pets it and realises that it was the same Patronus as `` James , '' his father . After Hermione and Buckbeak catch up , they wait until they see Walden leave the castle to retrieve Dementor . He and Hermione then fly Buckbeak up to West and rescue Black .",-0.105555555555556,9," 274 275 276 277 278 279 280 281 282",0.155555555555556,0.155555555555556,0.0222222222222222,0.133333333333333,0.0888888888888889,0.2,0.111111111111111,0.133333333333333,0.81756,-0.99981,0.58119
